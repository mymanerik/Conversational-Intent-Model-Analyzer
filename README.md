# Conversational Intent Model Analyzer

This project is a professional-grade conversion of an NDA project completed recently into a live working GitHub ready demo. It is an interactive web application that directly addresses evaluating and benchmarking leading AI models for the task of customer intent classification.

This application showcases a hands-on ability to `analyze AI-powered customer interactions`, `interpret consumer intent`, and `leverage insights... to refine AI intent models`.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
> add yur app link here <
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a sophisticated, hands-on understanding of the AI Data Analyst role by:

1.  **Evaluating AI Models for Intent Recognition:** The application makes real-time API calls to OpenAI (GPT-5), Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro), and Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). This simulates the process of "assessing model launch success" and selecting the best tool for accurately interpreting consumer intent.
2.  **Analyzing Interaction Data:** A dashboard visualizes a sample dataset of customer messages, demonstrating the ability to "identify trends to enhance system performance."
3.  **Simulating Model Optimization:** By comparing how different models handle the same input, the application provides the foundational data needed to "refine AI intent models, response selection, and decision pathways."
4.  **Building a Professional Tool:** The application is built with a secure, scalable approach, requiring users to input their own API keys—a standard practice in real-world AI development.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Live Multi-API Integration:** Perform intent classification using real-time calls to the latest models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.
* **Model Benchmarking Interface:** Directly compare how different state-of-the-art models classify the same customer message.
* **Searchable Model Catalog:** An organized, searchable dropdown shows awareness of the broader AI ecosystem, with a focus on the three fully integrated providers.
* **Secure, Multi-Key Input:** A sidebar allows users to securely input their API keys for each service.
* **Interaction Data Dashboard:** A bar chart visualizes the frequency of different intents from a sample dataset, highlighting where optimization efforts should be focused.

## 🛠️ How to Run

This application requires API keys from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to be fully functional.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.8+
* An **OpenAI API Key**: Get one from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
* A **Google API Key**: Get one from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
* An **Anthropic API Key**: Get one from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

**Setup Instructions:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone [Your GitHub Repo URL]
    cd [Your Repo Name]
    ```
2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
4.  Once the app is running, **enter your API keys in the sidebar** to activate the intent classification feature for the integrated models.

## 💡 How This Project Aligns with an AI Data Analyst Role

This project directly demonstrates the qualifications required for an AI Data Analyst role:

* **AI Data Analysis & Intent Modeling:** The core function of the app is to "analyze AI-powered customer interactions... ensuring AI models accurately interpret consumer intent."
* **Model Optimization & Continuous Improvement:** The app is a tool for "model evaluation." By highlighting misclassifications, it provides the exact data needed to "implement updates to conversational AI."
* **Data Curation & Annotation:** While not creating guidelines, it shows an understanding of the *result* of good data. Consistent misclassifications from a model would signal to an analyst that the "training data needs to be refined."
* **Data Analysis Expertise:** It uses pandas and Plotly to structure and visualize a dataset, a key skill for the role.

By building a tool that allows for the direct comparison and analysis of different AI models, this project demonstrates a proactive, data-driven approach to enhancing the quality of AI-powered conversations.
